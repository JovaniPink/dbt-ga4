  - name: base_ga4__events
    description: >
      Base events model that pulls all fields from raw data. Resulting table is partitioned on event_date_dt which 
      is useful in that BQ queries can be cached against this table, but not against wildcard searches from the original sharded tables. 
      Some light transformation and renaming beyond the base events model. 
      Adds surrogate keys for sessions and events
    columns:
      - name: event_date_dt
        description: Date of the event converted to Date type. Time zone is the time zone configured in the GA4 property. 
      - name: event_timestamp
        description: >
          Timestamp indicating when the event's batch was received (as opposed to when the event actually occurred).  
          Time zone is technically UTC, but in a practical sense it is set to the time zone configured in the GA4 property. 
      - name: user_campaign
        description: >
          Contains the initial campaign name that brought the user to the property. This has been renamed from traffic_source.name.
          From Google's documentation: Name of the marketing campaign that first acquired the user. This field is not populated in intraday tables.
          Note: traffic_source attribution is based on cross-channel last click. The traffic_source values do not change if the user interacts with subsequent campaigns after installation.
